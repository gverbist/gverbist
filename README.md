👋 Hi, I’m Geert Verbist!
A self-proclaimed nerd and curious explorer of tech, tools, and all things digital. I may not write code, but I sure know how to break it (and occasionally fix it).

🔍 What I do:

I tinker with tools like Docker, DeepSeek, and whatever shiny new app catches my eye.

I dive into the world of cybersecurity, asking questions like "How can this be hacked?" and "How do I protect it?"

I turn "I have no idea what I'm doing" into "Look, I made it work!"

🛠️ Tools I love:

Docker (for containerizing my chaos).

DeepSeek (for when I need a virtual rubber duck).

Brave (my true best friend and ad-blocking hero).

🌟 Fun fact:
I once spent an entire weekend configuring Neovim just to feel like a hacker. Totally worth it.

✍️ I blog about my nerdy adventures at bist.be.
It’s a mix of tech discoveries, cybersecurity insights, and the occasional "how-to" for fellow explorers.

🚀 My superpower:
Turning confusion into clarity, one Brave search at a time.
